The most interesting people
We didn’t used to need an explanation for having kids. That was just life. That’s just what you did. But now we do, because now we don’t.

So allow me: Having kids means making the most interesting people in the world. Not because toddlers or even teenagers are intellectual oracles — although life through their eyes is often surprising and occasionally even profound — but because your children will become the most interesting people to you.
